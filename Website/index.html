    <p> Welcome to the JRSmith Automation System, created by Rami and Jason. We specialize in many things, such as Microprocessors, WIFI Chips, Cameras, LEDs, Resistors, Capacitors, Jumpers, Wires, Solder Paste, Flux Paste, USB to UART Modules, Headers, and other important electronic components. Our world famous WEBCAM, <a href = "https://www.amazon.com/MGA-366560-Bratz-Be-Bratz-com-Webcam/dp/B000RFSO06/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1520456353&sr=8-5&keywords=child+webcam" target = "_blank"> which retails for a very reasonable price</a>, is perfect for all purposes, such as watching the EECS 395 Lab from the locker corner at all hours of the day. Use it to watch your students sleep while working 24 hours on their Firmware code, or fail to solder components the way they were instructed to! </p>

    <p id="review_text"> "Go home Evanston Yelp, you're drunk. How this place has a 4-star rating is a greater mystery to me than the origins of the universe. I bought a sad webcam and my kids bought some even sadder (probably microwaved) gaming consoles. Sad to say it because this place seems like it has a ton of poitential as a great neighbourhood NSA but I won't be returning unless they get a liquor license." - Jeff B.
